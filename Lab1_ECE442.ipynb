We will also introduce **[pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)**, an excellent library to load and process datasets efficiently. A third goal of this assigment is to start familiarizing ourselves with **[PyTorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**, a library built upon PyTorch to easily write and train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for a wide range of applications related to network data.\n",

Emails exchanged among several Enron employees in the period between November 1998 and June 2002 were made publicly available during the federal investigation; for additional details about the Enron scandal see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enron_scandal.  The completed dataset can be accessed from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/. Here we will use a smaller and curated version of the email corpus (for instance, with the email body removed), which can be obtained from http://cis.jhu.edu/~parky/Enron/enron.html.\n",

You are welcome to explore and play with the data beyond what we ask; let us know what you find!"
